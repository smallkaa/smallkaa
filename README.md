## Hi there, I'm Pavel 👋

I'm an engineering leader with a passion for building things—whether it's high-performing teams, scalable software, or a smart home that knows when to brew my coffee. After leading teams through major acquisitions and architectural shifts, I'm always looking for new challenges and opportunities to learn.

I’m currently working on sharpening my foundational C skills at Hive Helsinki and tinkering with my home automation setup using Home Assistant. Professionally, I advise startups on tech strategy and building robust engineering cultures.

Ask me about...

Building and leading engineering teams (and how to grow into a leadership role).
Surviving (and thriving) through a major company acquisition.
Smart Home tech, IoT, and home automation rabbit holes 🐇.
Getting kids excited about STEM.
